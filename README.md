# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- **`npm run build`**: Creates an optimized production build in the `build/` directory. The output is minified, and filenames include hashes. More details about deployment [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).
- **`npm run eject`**: Copies the configuration files to the project for advanced customization. **This action is irreversible.** Use only if necessary.
