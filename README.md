## Overview

This project was bootstrapped using **Create React App** and provides a modern development environment for React applications. It's easy to set up and run locally, as well as build for production. Below is the guide to get started with this project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### 🚀 `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### 🧪 `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### 📦 `npm run build`

Creates an optimized production build in the `build/` directory.  
The output is minified, and filenames include hashes for better caching.  
For more details on deployment, visit [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### ⚙️ `npm run eject`

Copies the configuration files to the project for advanced customization.  
**This action is irreversible.** Use only if necessary.

## Setting Up the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```

Replace `https://github.com/username/repository-name.git` with the URL of your repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

4. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. **Build for Production:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will create an optimized production build in the `build/` directory. The build is minified and ready for deployment.

### 🚨 Important Notes:

- When using **`npm run eject`**, keep in mind that this action is **irreversible**. It exposes the full configuration files and is recommended only for advanced customizations.

- If you encounter any issues, feel free to consult the **[Create React App Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started)** for further insights.

> **Tip**: To run tests during development, use the `npm test` command. This ensures your code remains error-free and functions as expected. 🛠️
